# Spectral Clustering of Stock Market Graph
 

## Description 

This project is developed by Sina Shahsavari and Sina Malekian.

## Abstract 
This document is about classifying companies based on their stock’s price fluctuation by using spectral clustering algorithms; especially graph laplacian. We will use correlation coefficient for constructing similarity matrix and MDS for decreasing dimension.
Index Terms—spectral clustering, graph laplacian, correlation coefficient matrix, Multidimensional scaling.
